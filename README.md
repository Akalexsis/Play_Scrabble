# Play_Scrabble

## About
This project uses Python to create a game of Scrabble where users can enter a word and the program will return the total amount of points the user has, based on the words they have entered.

## Features
This project:

- Uses dictionary comprehension to map each letter to a numerical value that's used to find the total points for a word
- Uses functions to iterate through each letter of a word to find the total points for that word and adds 0 points if that letter is not found in the game dictionary
- Uses a function to assign the total amount of points each player has

## Future Implementations
- Allow users to enter create their own user name
- Allow users to input whatever word they want
- Create UI for the game that displays the player's name, points, and an input box for them to enter their word
